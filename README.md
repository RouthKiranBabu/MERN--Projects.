# MERN--Projects.
Beyond testing, I develop full-stack projects to practice what strong QA engineers must understand deeply: how real systems behave in production — including REST APIs, middleware, database persistence, error handling, deployment, and edge cases.  This mini role helps me bridge the gap between: Developer Thinking ↔ QA Thinking ↔ Production Thinking.
